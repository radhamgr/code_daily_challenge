Problem 1

Akash and Vishal are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and 
they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like(<a href="https://github.com/radhamgr/code_daily_challenge/blob/master/train%20seats.jpg">train seats </a>)
So they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. The seats are denoted as follows :
Window Seat : WS
Middle Seat : MS
Aisle Seat : AS
You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.

INPUT

First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.

OUTPUT

For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.

Problem 2

Rotate a matrix of N * N by 90 degree in clockwise/anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.
The process will remain the same for both direction with small changes in index values to given matrix.

Problem 3

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [10,3,5,6,2] the expected output would be[180, 600, 360, 300, 900]

0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
